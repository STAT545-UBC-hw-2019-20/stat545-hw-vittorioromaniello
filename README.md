# Assignment repository STAT545 :book:

This repository contains the files submitted for the assignments for the course *STAT545* taught at UBC in fall 2019. Refer to the [course website](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca) for more information. 

The repository is structured in folders named `hw_X` where X is the assignment number.

## How to navigate the repository

Given the structure of the repository, it is very easy to retrieve files referring to a specific assignment. There are 2 ways of doing so:
1. (**Recommended**) Clone the repository on your machine and retrieve the files for the assignment directly from the folder of interest.
2. Navigate through the folder on github and view the file of interest from github.

Obviously the first method is preferred as cloning the repository will allow to modify files locally. Through method 1 when files are updated via a new commit on github, by pulling the repository you will be able to see the changes on your local machine, this has several advantages, especially if you are working with files that are in the repository. Method 2 is more error prone. To modify/work with files in the repository copy/pasting is needed and manual updating is needed in case changes are made to the files in the repository.

## Introduction of myself
